# Ascii Animation Web
This project is a simple ASCII animation in JavaScript, originally created during the development of my [personal website](https://mattia-loszach.com).
The animation was inspired by the animated background effect on [Midjourney's website](https://www.midjourney.com/home).

<img src="Demo/animation.gif" alt="Rotating donut" width="400">

The animation draws a swirling ASCII pattern around a customizable text or logo. It uses basic trigonometry (polar coordinates with r and theta) and simple noise to create a dynamic, lively visual.

You can easily embed this animation into any website or project.
It is also highly customizable â€” you can:
- Change the width, height, charset, and displayed text/logo.
- Replace the math with any 1D or 2D mathematical functions to create new interesting effects.
